# Hyppyear Webpage

This is a simple webpage designed to display a New Year countdown timer along with a fireworks animation in the background. The page uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a festive and interactive countdown experience leading up to New Year's Eve 2025.

## Features
- A **countdown timer** showing the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds until New Year 2025.
- A **fireworks animation** that continuously runs in the background.
- A **"Happy New Year!"** message that appears once the countdown reaches zero.
- Fully responsive design, adjusts to different screen sizes.
- Custom favicon and meta tags for social media sharing.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: Styling and positioning of elements.
- **JavaScript**: 
  - Countdown timer logic.
  - Fireworks animation using `<canvas>`.
- **Bootstrap**: Used for general page layout and styling (though not heavily utilized in the final version).

## How It Works
1. **Countdown Timer**:
   - The countdown is set to January 1, 2025 at 00:00:00.
   - The time left is displayed in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
   - Once the countdown reaches zero, the text changes to "Happy New Year!".

2. **Fireworks Animation**:
   - The fireworks are created using JavaScript's `<canvas>` API.
   - Fireworks are launched randomly at different positions and explode with particles in various directions.
   - Each firework has 100 particles that fade out as they move, creating a realistic animation.
